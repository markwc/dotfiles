Ferg's dotfiles
===============

These are Ferg's dotfiles. They personalize things such as aliases, bash
configurations, git prompts, etc. For example, `.bashrc`.


Install
-------

    git clone ssh://git@159.62.150.131:7999/~mferguso/dotfiles.git ~.dotfiles
    cd .dotfiles
    ./bootstrap

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.
